# [NMRiH] Runners Only
This is a very simple plugin that turns all shamblers into runners.

Unlike [DiffModer](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=301322), it does not break spawn rates or bosses.

| ConVar | Default Value | Description |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------- |
| runners_only | 1 | Enables or disables the plugin. 0 = off, 1 = on. |

For best results, use `sv_spawn_regen_target 0` to prevent zones from respawning zombies.
